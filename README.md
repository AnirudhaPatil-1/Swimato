*****(Swiggy Clone)*****
_**( May 2023 - May 2023)**_




I am excited to share my ReactJS project _**Swimato**_ - A Food Ordering App üçïüçü. 
Swimato is a clone of Swiggy, a popular food delivery app. 
It allows users to browse restaurants, view menus, add items to the cart, and place food orders.

## Key Features

- Shimmer UI: Provides a loading animation effect while data is being fetched.
- Search Feature: Allows users to search for specific restaurants or food items.
- Cart Feature: Enables users to add items to their cart and proceed to checkout.
- Checking Network Connection: Provides feedback to the user about their network connectivity status.

## Tech Stack

- **React JS** : Used for building the user interface and components.
- **Parcel** : Utilized for bundling the project's source code.
- **Redux** : Implemented for state management.
- **Tailwind CSS** : Utilized for styling the application.
